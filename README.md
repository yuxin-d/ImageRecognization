# Image_Recognization
# This is a Python-based project for image recognization for technical support in multiple areas.
For example:
1. Graphics decisions can be used in auto-car driving system design.
2. Financial service. In banking systems, image recognition technology can be used to verify the authenticity of a signature by comparing a user's handwritten signature with a pre-stored sample. This combined use can enhance the accuracy and security of signature authentication.

# When it will work?
- It will work when the image-shown circumstances is familiar for it. Also, it requires the picture has uniform atmosphere with special & clear (unique and outstanding)indivual's figures which is more likely to be recognized by this system.

# When it will fail?
- If the image contain the objects it has never seen (met/ be learned) before, the recognaztion will be incorrect and out of accurate. If the outline of one object is ambiguous or not unique (personalized) enough, it has a big chance be fail recognized.
More specific, it did not learn that the door can be looks like that way. Besides, the food of pig intestine just be shaped like a cake. It cannot reliaze the texture actually. And the well-cutted cucumber be imaged as apple also reflect this. The test is hard to work well when the presentation become trick
