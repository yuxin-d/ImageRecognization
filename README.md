# Image_Recognization
# This is a Python-based project for image recognization for technical support in multiple areas.
# For example:
1. Graphics decisions can be used in auto-car driving system design.
2. Financial service. In banking systems, image recognition technology can be used to verify the authenticity of a signature by comparing a user's handwritten signature with a pre-stored sample. This combined use can enhance the accuracy and security of signature authentication.
